# Data-Exploration-of-COVID-19-
In my SQL project exploring COVID-19 data, I embarked on an insightful journey to analyze and derive meaningful insights from a wealth of pandemic-related information. Leveraging SQL, I delved into extensive datasets, cleaned and organized the data, and created sophisticated queries to extract relevant information. Through this project, I unearthed trends in infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and regional disparities. The analysis facilitated a deep understanding of the pandemic's dynamics, allowing for data-driven decisions and responses. Additionally, I designed interactive dashboards to visually represent the data, enabling stakeholders to monitor and comprehend the evolving COVID-19 landscape with ease. This project not only enhanced my SQL skills but also contributed to the broader understanding of the pandemic's impact on health and society.
